Any entry not explicitly mentioned is assumed to have 0 probability.

The consequence of this are
    -> States not mentioned in the initial distribution are assumed to have 0 probability.
    -> States not mentioned in the from column of transition function are assumed to be absorbing states.
        This is corrected in the code.
